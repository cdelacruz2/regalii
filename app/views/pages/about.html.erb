It's about THEM.</h2>
<h3>Your family back home in the Dominican Republic and the unsafe way they receive the support & money that you give them.</h3>
<h2>What's unsafe about the way they receive money?</h2>
<h3>Well, let's look at the two biggest money agencies (that you probably already use) and see how unsafe they are.</h3>
​<h2>Western Union & La Nacional</h2>
﻿<h3>This is where we talk about how recipients receive money and we leverage the articles about recent robberies in D.R.</h3>
<h2>How is regalii's system better?</h2>
<h3>You send money back home for 3 main reasons: food, clothing, and bill payment. Our system allows you to send those things directly, thus making it a safer experience for your family member because they never have to deal with physical cash.</h3>
